# wandR

IEEE DragonHacks 2021

wandR is a cross-platform, native mobile application that works on both iOS and Android devices. It's built using Ionic-Angular for the front-end and Google Firebase for the back-end.

wandR measures how far the user travels over the course of one day. Two statistics are recorded: the total travel distance, and the maximum distance from your starting point.

Total Distance is fairly self explanatory: it measures the overall distance one has covered over the course of a day.

Max Distance is a little different: On the start of a new day, your "home" coordinate is recorded locally on your device. Then, GPS is used to determine the maximum straight line distance you reach away from "home". We felt like this feature would be something interesting to see; just how far do you go every day?

Additionally, we have the "Feed" which shows off the user's added friends. Their activities are listed on this page, as well as their distances for the day. To us, this felt like a fun way to share the experiences each of us has every single day.
